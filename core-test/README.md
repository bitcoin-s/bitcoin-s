## Running tests

To run the entire `core` test suite:

```bash
chris@chris:~/dev/bitcoins-core$ bloop test coreTest
```

## Coverage

To produce a report that quantifies how much of our code is covered by tests:

```bash
sbt
> coverage
> coreTest/test
> core/coverageReport
```

This generates three different reports: Cobertura, XML and HTML formats.
See the output of your sbt shell to find the location of them.
Open up the HTML file in your browser. You'll now see code coverage
of all files in `core` project.
