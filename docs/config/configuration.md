title: Application Configuration
---

Bitcoin-S uses [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md)
to configure various parts of the application the library offers. HOCON is a
superset of JSON, that is, all valid JSON is valid HOCON.

All configuration for Bitcoin-S is under the `bitcoin-s` key.

If you have a file `application.conf` anywhere on your classpath when using
bitcoin-s, the values there take precedence over the ones found in our
`reference.conf`. We also look for the file `bitcoin-s.conf` in the current
Bitcoin-S data directory.

The resolved configuration gets parsed by
[`AppConfig`](/api/org/bitcoins/db/AppConfig).
`AppConfig` is an abstract class that's implemented by corresponding case
classes in the `wallet`, `chain` and `node` projects. Here's some examples of how to
construct a wallet configuration:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import org.bitcoins.wallet.config.WalletAppConfig
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
import java.nio.file.Paths
import scala.util.Properties
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

// reads $HOME/.bitcoin-s/
val defaultConfig = WalletAppConfig.fromDefaultDatadir()


// reads a custom data directory
val customDirectory = Paths.get(Properties.userHome, "custom-bitcoin-s-directory")
val configFromCustomDatadir = WalletAppConfig(customDirectory)

// reads a custom data directory and overrides the network to be testnet3
val customOverride = ConfigFactory.parseString("bitcoin-s.network = testnet3")
val configFromCustomDirAndOverride = WalletAppConfig(customDirectory, customOverride)
```

You can pass as many `com.typesafe.config.Config`s as you'd like. If any
keys appear multiple times the last one encountered takes precedence.

## Command Line Options

There are a few command line options available that take precedence over configuration file.

- `--datadir <directory>`

     `datadir` sets the data directory instead of using the default `$HOME/.bitcoin-s`

- `--rpcbind <ip>`

    `rpcbind` sets the interface the rpc server binds to instead of using the default `127.0.0.1`

- `--rpcport <port>`

    `rpcport` sets the port the rpc server binds to instead of using the default `9999`

- `--force-recalc-chainwork`

    `force-recalc-chainwork` will force a recalculation of the entire chain's chain work, this
    can be useful if there is an incompatible migration or if it got out of sync.
    
- `-Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/config.xml`

    You can set a custom logback configuration. If you need help creating a custom logback file
    you can read [the logback configuration documentation](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html).

## Internal configuration

Database connections are also configured by using HOCON.
This is done in [`reference.conf`](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/blob/master/db-commons/src/main/resources/reference.conf) inside the `db-commons` module.
The options exposed here are **not** intended to be used by users of Bitcoin-S, and are internal only.

## Database Migrations

All of our modules that require databases now have database migrations. The tool we use for these migrations is 
called [flyway](https://flywaydb.org/). To find your projects migraitons, you need to look inside of the 
`[project-name]/src/main/resources/[database-name]/migration/`. For example, the chain projects migrations live under 
the path `chain/src/main/resources/chaindb/migration/V1__chain_db_baseline.sql`.

Migrations can be executed by calling the [`DbManagement.migrate()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/blob/e387d075b0ff2e0a0fec15788fcb48e4ddc4d9d5/db-commons/src/main/scala/org/bitcoins/db/DbManagement.scala#L92) 
method. Migrations are applied by default on server startup, via the [`AppConfig.start()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/blob/master/db-commons/src/main/scala/org/bitcoins/db/AppConfig.scala#L49)
method. 

These migrations are setup so that project's databases and migrations are independent of each other. Therefore if you
want to use the `bitcoin-s-chain` project, but not the `bitcoin-s-wallet` project, wallet migrations are not applied. 
It should be noted if you are using a module as a library, you are responsible for configuring the database via 
[slick's configuration](https://scala-slick.org/doc/3.3.1/database.html#using-typesafe-config) and calling 
[`AppConfig.start()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/blob/master/db-commons/src/main/scala/org/bitcoins/db/AppConfig.scala#L49)
to ensure the entire module is initialized correctly.

## Database configuration

By default, bitcoin-s uses Sqlite to store its data. 
It creates three Sqlite databases in `~/.bitcoin-s/${network}`: `chain.sqlite` for `chain` project, 
`node.sqlite` for `node` project and `wallet.sqlite` the wallet. This is the default configuration, 
it doesn't require additional changes in the config file. 

`bitcoin-s` also supports PostgreSQL as a database backend. In order to use a 
PostgreSQL database for all project you need to add following into your config file: 

```$xslt
bitcoin-s {
    common {
        profile = "slick.jdbc.PostgresProfile$"
        db {
            driver = org.postgresql.Driver

            # these 3 options will result into a jdbc url of
            # "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/database"
            name = database
            host = localhost
            port = 5432

            user = "user"
            password = "topsecret"
            numThreads = 5
            
            # http://scala-slick.org/doc/3.3.3/database.html
            connectionPool = "HikariCP"
            registerMbeans = true
        }
    }

    chain.profile = ${bitcoin-s.common.profile}
    chain.db = ${bitcoin-s.common.db}
    chain.db.poolName = "chain-connection-pool"

    node.profile = ${bitcoin-s.common.profile}
    node.db = ${bitcoin-s.common.db}
    node.db.poolName = "node-connection-pool"
    
    wallet.profile = ${bitcoin-s.common.profile}
    wallet.db = ${bitcoin-s.common.db}
    wallet.db.poolName = "wallet-connection-pool"

    oracle.profile = ${bitcoin-s.common.profile}
    oracle.db = ${bitcoin-s.common.db}
    oracle.db.poolName = "oracle-connection-pool"
}
```

The database driver will create a separate SQL namespace for each sub-project: `chain`, `node` and `wallet`.

Also you can use mix databases and drivers in one configuration. For example,
This configuration file enables Sqlite for `node` project (it's default, so its configuration 
is omitted), and `walletdb` and `chaindb` PostgreSQL databases for `wallet` and `chain` projects:

```$xslt
bitcoin-s {
    chain {
        profile = "slick.jdbc.PostgresProfile$"
        db {
            driver = org.postgresql.Driver
            name = chaindb
            host = localhost
            port = 5432
            user = "user"
            password = "topsecret"
        }
    }
    wallet {
        profile = "slick.jdbc.PostgresProfile$"
        db {
            driver = org.postgresql.Driver
            name = walletdb
            host = localhost
            port = 5432
            user = "user"
            password = "topsecret"
        }
    }
}
```
