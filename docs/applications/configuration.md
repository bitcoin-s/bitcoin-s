title: Application Configuration
---

Bitcoin-S uses [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md)
to configure various parts of the application the library offers. HOCON is a
superset of JSON, that is, all valid JSON is valid HOCON.

All configuration for Bitcoin-S is under the `bitcoin-s` key.

If you have a file `application.conf` anywhere on your classpath when using
bitcoin-s, the values there take precedence over the ones found in our
`reference.conf`. We also look for the file `bitcoin-s.conf` in the current
Bitcoin-S data directory.

The resolved configuration gets parsed by
[`AppConfig`](../../db-commons/src/main/scala/org/bitcoins/db/AppConfig.scala).
`AppConfig` is an abstract class that's implemented by corresponding case
classes in the `wallet`, `chain` and `node` projects. Here's some examples of how to
construct a wallet configuration:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import org.bitcoins.wallet.config.WalletAppConfig
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
import java.nio.file.Paths
import scala.util.Properties

// reads $HOME/.bitcoin-s/
val defaultConfig = WalletAppConfig.fromDefaultDatadir()


// reads a custom data directory
val customDirectory = Paths.get(Properties.userHome, "custom-bitcoin-s-directory")
val configFromCustomDatadir = WalletAppConfig(customDirectory)

// reads a custom data directory and overrides the network to be testnet3
val customOverride = ConfigFactory.parseString("bitcoin-s.network = testnet3")
val configFromCustomDirAndOverride = WalletAppConfig(customDirectory, customOverride)
```

You can pass as many `com.typesafe.config.Config`s as you'd like. If any
keys appear multiple times the last one encountered takes precedence.

## Internal configuration

Database connections are also configured by using HOCON. This is done in
[`db.conf`](../../db-commons/src/main/resources/db.conf). The options
exposed here are **not** intended to
be used by users of Bitcoin-S, and are internal only.

## Database Migrations

All of our modules that require databases now have database migrations. The tool we use for these migrations is 
called [flyway](https://flywaydb.org/). To find your projects migraitons, you need to look inside of the 
`[project-name]/src/main/resources/[database-name]/migration/`. For example, the chain projects migrations live under 
the path `chain/src/main/resources/chaindb/migration/V1__chain_db_baseline.sql`.

Migrations can be executed by calling the [`DbManagement.migrate()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/blob/e387d075b0ff2e0a0fec15788fcb48e4ddc4d9d5/db-commons/src/main/scala/org/bitcoins/db/DbManagement.scala#L92) 
method. Migrations are applied by default on server startup, via the [`AppConfig.initialize()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/blob/master/db-commons/src/main/scala/org/bitcoins/db/AppConfig.scala#L49) 
method. 

These migrations are setup so that project's databases and migrations are independent of each other. Therefore if you
want to use the `bitcoin-s-chain` project, but not the `bitcoin-s-wallet` project, wallet migrations are not applied. 
It should be noted if you are using a module as a library, you are responsible for configuring the database via 
[slick's configuration](https://scala-slick.org/doc/3.3.1/database.html#using-typesafe-config) and calling 
[`AppConfig.initialize()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/blob/master/db-commons/src/main/scala/org/bitcoins/db/AppConfig.scala#L49) 
to ensure the entire module is initialized correctly.

## Example Configuration File
```$xslt

    logging {
        level = WARN # trace, debug, info, warn, error, off

        # You can also tune specific module loggers.
        # They each take the same levels as above.
        # If they are commented out (as they are
        # by default), `logging.level` gets used
        # instead. 
        # The available loggers are: 

        # incoming and outgoing P2P messages
        # p2p = info

        # verification of block headers, merkle trees
        # chain-verification = info

        # generation of addresses, signing of TXs
        # key-handling = info

        # wallet operations not related to key management
        # wallet = info

        # HTTP RPC server
        # http = info

        # Database interactions
        # database = info

        # Port number is optional, the default value is 8333 for mainnet,
        # 18333 for testnet and 18444 for regtest.
