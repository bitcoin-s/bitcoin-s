title: Light Client
---

Bitcoin-S comes bundled with a light client Bitcoin node. this client
is capable of doing verification of some parts of the blockchain,
and can act as a starting point for building Bitcoin applications
that need to connect to the P2P network.

This node is currently only released as a library, and not as a binary.
This is because it (nor the documentation) is not deemed production
ready. Use at your own risk, and without too much money depending on it.
