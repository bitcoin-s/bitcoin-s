### Running bitcoin-s

#### Docker

In this repo, you can just run

```
APP_PASSWORD=topsecret docker-compose up
```

which will spin up a docker environment that starts syncing the backend and will allow you to visit
the web frontend of the wallet at `localhost:3002`

or you can run the binaries natively, here are the instructions.
