### Running bitcoin-s

#### Docker

In this repo, you can just run

```
APP_PASSWORD=topsecret docker-compose up
```

which will spin up a docker environment that starts syncing the backend and will allow you to visit
the web frontend of the wallet at `localhost:3002`

or you can build and run the electron app natively.

```
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s-ts.git
cd bitcoin-s-ts && ./build-wallet-electron.sh
```
