/**
  * Created by chris on 5/19/16.
  * Nodes collect new transactions into a block, hash them into a hash tree,
  * and scan through nonce values to make the block's hash satisfy proof-of-work
  * requirements.  When they solve the proof-of-work, they broadcast the block
  * to everyone and the block is added to the block chain.  The first transaction
  * in the block is a special one that creates a new coin owned by the creator
  * of the block.
