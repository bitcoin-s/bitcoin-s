# 1.7.0 DLC wallet & Installers

## Running Bitcoin-S

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-1.7.0.zip` and then run it with `./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

You can then unzip the `bitcoin-s-cli-1.7.0.zip` folder and start using the `bitcoin-s-cli` like this:

```bashrc
./bin/bitcoin-s-cli --help
Usage: bitcoin-s-cli [options] [<cmd>]

  -n, --network <value>    Select the active network.
  --debug                  Print debugging information
  --rpcport <value>        The port to send our rpc request to on the server
  -h, --help               Display this help message and exit
```

For more information on what commands `bitcoin-s-cli` supports check the documentation, here is where to
start: https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#server-endpoints

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910`

To do the verification, first hash the executable using `sha256sum`. You should check that the result is listed in
the `SHA256SUMS.asc` file next to its file name. After doing that you can use `gpg --verify` to authenticate the
signature.

Example:

UPDATE ME!!!!!!!
```
$ sha256sum bitcoin-s-server-1.7.0.tgz
aa1084edb5fcd3d1dbcafe0d0fba787abf4cd455bbe38809bd9a65a49c0cd0eb bitcoin-s-server-1.7.0.tgz
$ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
gpg: Signature made Thu 24 Sep 2020 12:49:39 PM CDT
gpg:                using RSA key 339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910
gpg:                issuer "stewart.chris1234@gmail.com"
gpg: Good signature from "Chris Stewart <stewart.chris1234@gmail.com>"
```

# Executive Summary

## DLC Wallet

This release merges our feature branch called `adaptor-dlc` into master. This means 
that all DLC features are now in our `master` branch.

## Installers

We now support installers for mac, windows, and linux (deb) builds. Everytime a PR is merged into master, 
we publish artifacts for that commit. For more information, please see our [website](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/getting-started#java-binaries)

With these installers, you can install the bitcoin-s wallet and start using DLCs with a rudimentary GUI.
In future releases, we will be iterating and improving the GUI user experience.

## Versioning changes

To support publishing artifacts for both mac and windows, we had to drop the leading `v` on our version scheme.
We also were required by apple to add a leading `1` to our version scheme. Thus, this release will be `1.7.0`
rather than the expected version of `v0.7.0`.

## New modules

### DLC wallet 

This new module contains all logic for our DLC Wallet

### Tor

We are beginning to integrate TOR support into bitcoin-s to for a variety of reasons.
In this release, we have added bare bones support, in future releases we will be integrating
this deeper into other modules.

## Bundle

Bundle combines both the GUI and AppServer project and bundles them together to make a standalone application.
One problem we encountered this release is how to allow users to configure their node from the GUI on first startup.

In #3142 we added support for this by adding a new configuration file that is automatically generated and written
to `~/.bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s-bundle.conf`. This file saves the user's configuration, and uses it the next
time the bundle is started.

## Cli

## Core

Most changes in the `core` module this release is related to optimizing adaptor point computations.
This is very important as when doing numeric DLCs we have to generate thousands of points.
We use parallelism to speed up this computation.

The other notable change in `core` is adding `DLCAccounting`. This is used to caclulate things like PNL
and rate of return for a DLC you were in.
