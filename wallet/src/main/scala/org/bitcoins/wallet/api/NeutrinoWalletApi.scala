  /**
    * Recreates the account using BIP-157 approach

    * DANGER! This method removes all records from the wallet database
    * and creates new ones while the account discovery process.
    *
    * The Wallet UI should check if the database is empty before calling
    * this method and let the end users to decide whether they want to proceed or not.
    *
    * This method generates [[addressBatchSize]] of addresses, then matches them against the BIP-158 compact filters,
    * and downloads and processes the matched blocks. This method keeps doing the steps until there are [[WalletConfig.addressGapLimit]]
    * or more unused addresses in a row. In this case it considers the discovery process completed.
    *
    * [[addressBatchSize]] - the number of addresses we should generate from a keychain to attempt to match in in a rescan
    * [[WalletConfig.addressGapLimit]] - the number of addresses required to go without a match before we determine that our wallet is "discovered".
    * For instance, if addressBatchSize=100, and AddressGapLimit=20 we do a rescan and the last address we find containing
    * funds is at index 75, we would not generate more addresses to try and rescan. However if the last index containing
    * funds was 81, we would generate another 100 addresses from the keychain and attempt to rescan those.

    * @param endOpt end block (if None it ends at the current tip)
    * @param addressBatchSize how many addresses to match in a single pass
