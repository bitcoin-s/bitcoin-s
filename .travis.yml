# Fiddling with Travis config is not fun:-(
# To avoid spending too much time waiting on Travis, you
# can use this tool to parse the config file locally: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-yml
# After getting it set up, do:
# $ curl -X POST --data-binary @.travis.yml localhost:9292/v1/parse | jq
# this should return a big JSON object, where especially
# config.matrix.include tells you a lot about what the build
# is going to look like

    # this way of including jobs is not ideal... unfortunately it's not
    # possible to nest env.matrix. could a better solution be to write
    # a small script that generates a Travis config for us?
