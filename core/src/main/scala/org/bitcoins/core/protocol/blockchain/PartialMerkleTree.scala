/**
  * Created by chris on 8/7/16.
  * Represents a subset of known txids inside of a [[org.bitcoins.core.protocol.blockchain.Block Block]]
  * in a way that allows recovery of the txids & merkle root
  * without having to store them all explicitly.
  * See
  * [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki#partial-merkle-branch-format BIP37]]
  * for more details
  *
  * Encoding procedure:
  * [[https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#creating-a-merkleblock-message "Bitcoin.org: creating a merkleblock message"]]
  * [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b7b48c8bbdf7a90861610b035d8b0a247ef78c45/src/merkleblock.cpp#L78 "Bitcoin Core: merkleblock.cpp"]]
  * Traverse the tree in depth first order, storing a bit for each traversal.
  * This bit signifies if the node is a parent of at least one
  * matched leaf txid (or a matched leaf txid) itself.
  * In case we are the leaf level, or this bit is 0, it's merkle
  * node hash is stored and it's children are not explored any further.
  * Otherwise no hash is stored, but we recurse all of this node's child branches.
  *
  * Decoding procedure:
  * [[https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#parsing-a-merkleblock-message "Bitcoin.org: parsing a merkleblock message"]]
  * [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b7b48c8bbdf7a90861610b035d8b0a247ef78c45/src/merkleblock.cpp#L96 "Bitcoin Core: merkleblock.cpp"]]
  * The same depth first decoding procedure is performed, but we consume the
  * bits and hashes that we used during encoding
